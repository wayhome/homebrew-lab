my formula for homebrew



How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------
Just `brew tap youngking/lab` and then `brew install <formula>`.

If the formula conflicts with one from mxcl/master or another tap, you can `brew install youngking/lab/<formula>`.

You can also install via URL:

```
brew install https://raw.github.com/youngking/homebrew-lab/master/<formula>.rb
```
